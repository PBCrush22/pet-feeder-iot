# pet-feeder-iot

This project is an automated pet feeder controlled via Blynk and an ESP8266 microcontroller. The feeder can dispense food at scheduled times or manually via a button in the Blynk app.

## Summary

- Designed and implemented a mobile-controlled automated pet feeder system to dispense food at pre-determined times or via manual activation, ensuring consistent pet feeding routines.
- Configured the Blynk app to enhance the user interface, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- Utilized the ESP8266 microcontroller for wireless communication and control signals, ensuring reliable connectivity and functionality.
- Integrated an SG90 servo motor for a precise food dispensing mechanism, programmed for accurate and consistent operation.


## Features

- Schedule feeding times: Set up specific times for automatic feeding to ensure your pet gets regular meals.
- Manual feeding: Dispense food manually at any time using the Blynk app interface.
- Adjustable portion sizes: Customize the amount of food dispensed during each feeding session.
